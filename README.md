# Paper Puppets

*A lab report by Karim Arem*


## Part A. Actuating DC motors

**Link to a video of your virbation motor**

## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**

Brown: Ground
Red: Power
Yellow: Signal

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**

Should connect to pin 9.

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**

The delay function controls the speed of the motor while the parameters in the for loop control the angle. (0 to 180)

## Part C. Integrating input and output

**Include a photo/movie of your raw circuit in action.**

## Part D. Paper puppet

**a. Make a video of your proto puppet.**

## Part E. Make it your own

**a. Make a video of your final design.**
